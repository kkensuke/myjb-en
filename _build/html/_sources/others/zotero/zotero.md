Useful settings for beginners are below.

- Open preferences[press Cmd and ,], and uncheck the box of [Automatically take snapshots …] in [General]

:name: set-general

:align: center
```

---
- You don't have to check [Enable the Zotero PDF reader] if you wanna use the default PDF viewer.
- Zotero -> Preferences -> Sync. Check all the boxes of [Data Syncing], uncheck all the boxes of [File Syncing] if you wanna use another cloud such as Google Drive (note Zotero storage is up to 300MB). To use Google Drive as a Zetoro cloud, you have to go to [Advanced] in the preferences, and open [Files and Folders]. Here, you specify the path to the base directory in your Google Drive.

:name: set-sync
:width: 600px
:align: center
```
```{image} img/advanced.png
:name: set-advanced
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

- You also need to install ZotFile, which is a useful tool and necessary for Syncing. If you finish download, open [Tools -> Addon -> ⚙ -> Install Add-on From File], and restart. Again, open [Tools -> ZotFile preferences]. In the General setting, specify the same path as above in [Source Folder for Attaching New Files, Location of Files], and set [Use subfolder defined by /%c] to keep the same directory structure.

:name: set-zot-general
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

---
- If you download a pdf file from the browser to Zotero, you can see files in Google Drive by doing the following. Right-click the files, and select [Manage Attachment-> Rename Attachment] (actually, it's easy to choose all the files and do the same procedure so that you don't need to find files you've downloaded. Doing this many times doesn't change anything).
```{image} img/rename.png
:name: rename
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

---
- (Optional)[Tools] in the menu bar -> Zotfile Preferences -> Renaming Rules -> uncheck [Use Zotero to Rename], and fill two lines below with {%t}{_%y}{_%a}, and Additional Settings is up to you(setting example is below).
```{image} img/zotfile-preferences.png
:name: set-zot-pref
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

```{note}
It seems Zotero for iOS beta is coming soon.
