`alt` : text
: Text to be displayed if the figure cannot be displayed or if the reader is using assistive technologies. Generally entails a short description of the figure.

`align` : “left”, “center”, or “right”

## key

To use a substitution, first add front-matter content to the top of a page like so:
````
---
substitutions:
  image: |
    ```{image} Programming/GitHub/img/GitHub-flow.png
    :alt: image
    :width: 200px
    ```
---
````
and use like this: `{{image}}`

{{image}}


### Define substitutions for your whole book

You can also define book-level substitution variables with the following configuration:

```
parse:
  myst_substitutions:
    key0: global-value
```
global value: {{key0}}


### Formatting substitutions
The original key1: {{ key1 }}
{{ key1 | replace("a substitution", "the best substitution")}}

```
substitutions:
  repo_url: [my repo url](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book)
  ```

## Footnotes
[^mylabel]: My footnote text.

## Custom <div> blocks
```{div} my-class
**Some content.**
```

## Check for missing references

You can check for missing references when building a Jupyter Book. To do so, use the following options:
```
jupyter-book build -W -n --keep-going docs/
```

## Layout
full-width
```{note}
:class: full-width
Here's a note that will take the full width
```

## Proofs, Theorems, and Algorithms

This is not currently a default package in jupyter-book as is a relatively new package.
```
pip install sphinx-proof
```

It needs to be enabled through the _config.yml after installation.

```
sphinx:
  extra_extensions:
    - sphinx_proof
```

# Build and publish outputs
## Store code outputs and insert into content

## Generate a badge for your book
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](<https://github.com/kk564/jb-test.git>)
Additionally, you can generate a badge directly from [shields.io](https://shields.io/). Here’s the URL to auto-generate the badge above, using a base64-encoded version of the Jupyter Book logo. Feel free to modify this as you wish!

## Build a PDF using LaTeX

### Book Style PDF

To build a PDF of your project using LaTeX, use the following command:
```
jupyter-book build mybookname/ --builder pdflatex [--individualpages]
Copy to clipboard
or

jb build mybookname/ --builder pdflatex [--individualpages]
```

````{note} Note
If you would just like to generate the latex file you may use:
```
jb build mybookname/ --builder latex
```
````


## Check external links in your book

If you’d like to make sure that the links outside of your book are valid, run the Sphinx link checker with Jupyter Book. This will check each of your external links and ensure that they resolve.

Note that you must ensure each link is the right target, the link checker will only ensure that it resolves.
To run the link checker, use the following command:
```
jupyter-book build mybookname/ --builder linkcheck
```
It will print the status of each link in your book so that you may resolve any incorrect links later on.

## Configuring to Improve Accessibility

Declaring the primary language used in your book assists screen reader and browser translation tools.

Language can be configured by providing the appropriate language code to the language option, under sphinx configuration in your _config.yml file:
```
sphinx:
  config:
    language: en
```


## Defining TeX macros

You can add LaTeX macros for the whole book by defining them under the Macros option of the TeX block. For example, the following two macros have been pre-defined in the Sphinx configuration
```
sphinx:
  config:
    mathjax_config:
      TeX:
        Macros:
          "N": "\\mathbb{N}"
          "floor": ["\\lfloor#1\\rfloor", 1]
          "bmat" : ["\\left[\\begin{array}"]
          "emat" : ["\\end{array}\\right]"]
```
You can also define TeX macros for a specific file by introducing them at the beginning of the file under a math directive. For example

````
```{math}
\newcommand\N{\mathbb{N}}
\newcommand\floor[1]{\lfloor#1\rfloor}
\newcommand{\bmat}{\left[\begin{array}}
\newcommand{\emat}{\end{array}\right]}
```
````
