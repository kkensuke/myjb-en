/	root dir\
\.	current dir\
\.\.	parent dir\
~	home dir


`pwd`:	show current directory

`mkdir`: make directory
```zsh
mkdir ~/tmp
```

`cd`: change directory
```zsh
cd ~/tmp
```

`touch`: make file or directory
```zsh
touch file
```

`ls`: list files or directories
```zsh
ls
# file
```

`mkdir -p`; make parent directories as needed 
```zsh
mkdir -p dir/subdir/ssubdir
ls
# file dir
```

`rm`: remove file(s)\
`rm -r`: remove directories and their contents
```zsh
rm file
rm -r dir
```

cf.
```zsh
rm -v file # show filename when removed
rm -i file # comfirm whether to rmove
rm -f file # force remove
```

`rmdir`:		remove empty directory
```zsh
mkdir dir
ls
# dir
rmdir dir
ls
# (nothing)
```

cf.
```zsh
rmdir -p dir/subdir/ssubdir
```


`echo`:
- print environment variables
```zsh
echo $PATH
```
- make files with contents
    - Make new file or overwrite existing file
```zsh
echo [Strings] > [filename]
```
    - Append
```zsh
echo [Strings] >> [filename]
```

`cat`: print file contents
```zsh
touch file1
echo hello > file1
cat file1
# hello
```

```zsh
cat > file2
asdf  (input something)
Ctrl + D (end input)
cat file2
# asdf
```

`cp`: copy file(s) or directory(ies)
```zsh
cp file1 file3
cat file3
# hello
```

```zsh
mkdir dir1
touch dir1/file4
cp -r dir1 dir2
ls dir2
# file4
```

```{note}
When doing `cp file1 file2` and the file2 already exists,
you will be asked whether to overwrite the contents of file2.

If the file2 does not exist, the contents of file1 will be copied to file2.

When doing `cp -r dir1 dir2` and the dir2 already exists, new dir1 will be created in dir2.

If the directory2 does not exist, the contents of dir1 will be copied to dir2. So the contents of these directories are the same.
```

`mv`: move file(s) or directory(ies)
If file5 does not exist, the following operation is rename
```zsh
mv file1 file5
mkdir dir3
mv file5 dir3
```

If dir4 does not exist, the following operation is rename. Otherwise dir1 will be moved to dir4.
```zsh
mv dir1 dir4
```

`tree`: print contents of current directory in tree format. You can use `tree -d` to print directory contents. You can use `tree -L` to print directory contents up to a certain level.
You have to install `tree` command in zsh first.
```zsh
brew install tree
```

```zsh
tree
test
├── dir2
│   └── file4
├── dir3
│   └── file5
├── dir4
│   └── file4
├── file2
└── file3
```

```zsh
# print directory contents up to level 2
tree -L 2
```

`chomd`: change file modes(permissions)
```zsh
chmod 755 file
```

You can specify the mode with octal number or with symbol like `u+x` for user, `g+x` for group, `o+x` for others.

When you specify the mode with octal number;\
4 stands for "read"\
2 stands for "write"\
1 stands for "execute" \
0 stands for "no permission"

If you permit all operations(4+2+1) to everyone, you can use `777` for example.
If you permit all operations(4+2+1) to owner and read and execute(4+1) to group and others, you can use `755` for example.

|target| meaning|
|----|----|
|u|	User|
|g| Group|
|o| Others|
|a|	All|

|operation| meaning|
|----|----|
|=|	set the modes|
|+|	add the mode|
|-|	remove the mode|

|mode| meaning|
|----|----|
|r|	read|
|w|	write|
|x|	execute|
```

For example,
```zsh
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file

chmod u+x file
```

You can use `chmod -R` to change permissions recursively.


## Shell globbing

`glob patterns` specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters. Using `glob` is a powerful way to find files that match a pattern. For example, `*.txt` means all files with the extension `.txt` in the current directory.

There are several common wildcard characters:
```zsh
* : matches zero or more characters
? : matches any single character
[abc] : matches any character in set
[a-z] : matches any character in range
[!abc] : matches any character not in set
[!a-z] : matches any character not in range
```

Some examples:
```zsh
# move all files and directories to `dir`
mv * dir
# move foo.txt, bar.txt, and baz.txt in path to `dir`
# = mv ./path/foo.txt ./path/bar.txt ./path/baz.txt `dir`
mv ./path/{foo,bar,baz}.txt dir
# move all pyhon and shell files to `dir`
mv *{.py,.sh} dir
```


`find`: find files and directories
```zsh
# search current directory for filename(not recursively)
find filename

# search target directory recursively for lecture0~lecture9 directories (cf. -type f)
find target -name lecture[0-9] -type d

# search current directory recursively for files accessed within 1 day(. represents current directory)
find . -atime -1

# search current directory recursively for files modified within 1 day
find . -mtime -1

# search current directory recursively for files with size between 30kB and 1MB
find . -size +30k -size -1M -name '*.py'

# search target directory recursively for files or directories that match condition1 and condition2 (cf. -or, -not)
find target condtion1 -and condition2

# search current directory recursively for .txt files and remove them all.
find . -name '*.txt' -exec rm {} \;
```

`grep`: search files for patterns
```zsh
# Search any line that contains `word` in filename
grep [-Options] 'word' filename 

grep 'word' file1 file2 file3
grep 'string1 string2'  filename
```

| Options |	Description |
|---------|-------------|

|-r | Search directories recursivly|
|-R | Just like -r but follow all symlinks|
|-l | Print only names of FILEs with matches
|-L | Print only names of FILEs without matches|
|-c | Print only a count of selected lines per FILE|
|--color | Display matched pattern in colors|
|-m NUMBER | Stop grep command NUMBER selected lines|
|-o | Display only matched parts of lines|


`ln -s`: symbolic links
```zsh
ln -s original-dir/file where/to/put/SymboliLink
```
