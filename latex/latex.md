# Latex

## [Settings](./settings.md)

$\LaTeX$ settings for VSCode.

## Preamble

In a `preamble.tex`, we can load packages, define commands, and set some options for the document.

Sometimes, you can't use some packages due to the conflicts between packages and document classes. So, you need to change the settings in the preamble according to the document class.

You also have to care about the conflicts between packages themselves because you can't use some packages together, or you need to load them in a specific order.

We are going to see some examples of the preamble for some document classes.

- [article](./article.md)
- [revtex4-2](./revtex4-2.md)
- [beamer](./beamer.md)
- [\newcommands](./newcommands.md)
